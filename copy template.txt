Gen Mind Over Matters
{catch phrase shit}

Gen-MOM is a non-profit project made to help people between 13 and 25. We advocate for their mental health, and focus on solving such challenges with Web3 and On-chain technologies.

Why we do this
We are seeing a trend of teens and youths hiding and suppressing mental health issues. They don't understand whats wrong with them, so they'd rather not talk about it. Eventually, avoiding these issues can lead to severe depression, and ultimately in suicide. We hope our efforts help prevent hundreds of millions of teens from facing this sad fate. We do this best by looking to the future; Web3. We know Web3 technologies such as NFTs, Cryptocurrencies, among other decentralised tools can help.
{side note: check out our breakdown of Web3 and associated technologies}
