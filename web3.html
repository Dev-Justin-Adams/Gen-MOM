    <section class="intro">
        <h2>What is Web 3.0?</h2>
        <p>Web 3.0, also known as the decentralized web, represents the latest and most transformative stage of internet evolution. Unlike Web 2.0, which centralized control over data and applications, Web 3.0 aims to decentralize the web, giving users more control over their data, privacy, and online interactions through technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.</p>

    <section class="blockchain">
        <h2>Key Technologies Behind Web 3.0</h2>

        <h3>1. Blockchain</h3>
        <p>Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers. It ensures data integrity and security by making it nearly impossible to alter the recorded data without altering every single block in the chain, which is why blockchain is central to Web 3.0’s promise of transparency and security.</p>

        <h3>2. Smart Contracts</h3>
        <p>Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on blockchain technology and eliminate the need for intermediaries by automatically enforcing contract conditions once specific triggers are met.</p>

        <h3>3. Decentralized Applications (dApps)</h3>
        <p>dApps are applications that run on a decentralized network, typically a blockchain. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralized servers, dApps are hosted on a peer-to-peer network, ensuring they are resistant to censorship and control.</p>

        <h3>4. Cryptographic Tokens</h3>
        <p>Cryptographic tokens serve as digital assets within Web 3.0 ecosystems. These tokens can represent various assets, such as currency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum), digital property (NFTs), or even governance rights in decentralized organizations.</p>

    <section class="decentralization">
        <h2>The Power of Decentralization</h2>
        <p>Web 3.0 shifts power away from centralized institutions (e.g., corporations, governments) and toward individuals and communities. This decentralization is powered by distributed networks that remove single points of failure, reducing vulnerabilities to hacking, censorship, and data exploitation.</p>
        <p>By leveraging technologies like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), decentralized storage protocols, and mesh networks, Web 3.0 enables more robust and secure data storage and transfer.</p>

    <section class="future">
        <h2>Challenges and the Future of Web 3.0</h2>
        <p>Despite its potential, Web 3.0 faces significant challenges. Scalability remains an issue for blockchain-based systems, where network congestion can hinder performance. Additionally, the decentralized nature of Web 3.0 raises concerns about regulation, security, and user experience, as many Web 3.0 applications still require technical know-how to navigate effectively.</p>
        <p>However, with the development of technologies such as Layer 2 solutions, sharding, and zero-knowledge proofs, the future of Web 3.0 looks promising, offering more secure, user-centric online ecosystems.</p>
